## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Angular](https://angular.io/docs) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Programming Language
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/)
- [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/)

### What I learned

This is my first time working with Angular, GraphQL and AWS. This is a simple vehicle management system app. I learned the fundamentals of these technologies. Also I brush by skills in typescript and javascript.

### Continued development

For the future probably I will focus on all of three frontend frameworks and also I will improve my backend skills.
